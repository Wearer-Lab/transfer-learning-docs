transfer-learning monitor dashboard
```

This will start the dashboard server and open it in your default web browser. By default, the dashboard is available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Dashboard Sections

### Processing Overview

The Processing Overview section provides a high-level view of your Transfer Learning operations:

- **Active Jobs**: Currently running processing jobs
- **Completed Jobs**: Recently completed jobs
- **Failed Jobs**: Jobs that encountered errors
- **Queue Status**: Jobs waiting in the processing queue

### Performance Metrics

The Performance Metrics section displays detailed metrics for video processing:

- **Processing Time**: Time taken to process videos
- **Frames Per Second**: Processing rate for frame extraction
- **API Response Times**: Response times for external API calls
- **Batch Processing Efficiency**: Efficiency of batch processing operations

### Resource Usage

The Resource Usage section shows system resource utilization:

- **CPU Usage**: CPU utilization during processing
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption
- **Disk I/O**: Disk read/write operations
- **Network Usage**: Network bandwidth utilization

### Error Tracking

The Error Tracking section provides information about errors and exceptions:

- **Error Rates**: Error rates by command and operation
- **Error Types**: Distribution of error types
- **Error Timeline**: Timeline of errors over time
- **Retry Statistics**: Statistics for retry attempts

## Configuration

You can configure the monitoring dashboard using environment variables or the `.env` file:

```bash
# Dashboard configuration
DASHBOARD_PORT=8501
DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0
DASHBOARD_THEME=light
DASHBOARD_REFRESH_INTERVAL=5
```

## Integration with External Monitoring

Transfer Learning can integrate with external monitoring systems:

- **Prometheus**: Export metrics to Prometheus
- **Grafana**: Visualize metrics in Grafana dashboards
- **ELK Stack**: Send logs to Elasticsearch for analysis in Kibana
- **DataDog**: Send metrics and logs to DataDog
