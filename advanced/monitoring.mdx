# Monitoring and Metrics

Transfer Learning includes comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection capabilities to help you track performance, usage, and potential issues. This page covers how to use and extend these monitoring features.

## Logging System

Transfer Learning uses a structured logging system that records information about operations, errors, and performance metrics.

### Log Levels

The following log levels are available:

- `DEBUG`: Detailed debugging information
- `INFO`: General information about operations
- `WARNING`: Warning messages for potential issues
- `ERROR`: Error messages for failures
- `CRITICAL`: Critical errors that require immediate attention

### Log Configuration

You can configure logging through environment variables:

```
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
LOGS_DIR=logs/
```

### Log File Structure

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory with the following structure:

```
logs/
├── transfer-learning.log        # Main log file
├── transfer-learning.error.log  # Error log file
└── daily/
    ├── transfer-learning-2023-02-25.log
    └── transfer-learning-2023-02-26.log
```

### Viewing Logs

You can view logs using standard tools:

```bash
# View the main log file
cat logs/transfer-learning.log

# View only error logs
cat logs/transfer-learning.error.log

# Follow logs in real-time
tail -f logs/transfer-learning.log
```

## Metrics Collection

Transfer Learning collects various metrics to help you understand performance and usage patterns.

### Enabling Metrics

Metrics collection is enabled by default. You can disable it by setting:

```
ENABLE_METRICS=False
```

### Metrics Storage

Metrics are stored in the `metrics/` directory in JSON format:

```
metrics/
├── performance/
│   ├── 2023-02-25/
│   │   ├── process_video_1.json
│   │   └── generate_guide_1.json
│   └── 2023-02-26/
│       ├── process_video_1.json
│       └── youtube_guide_1.json
├── usage/
│   ├── daily_usage.json
│   └── command_usage.json
└── errors/
    └── error_counts.json
```

### Available Metrics

Transfer Learning collects the following types of metrics:

#### Performance Metrics

- Processing time per video
- Processing time per frame
- API response times
- Memory usage
- CPU usage

#### Usage Metrics

- Command usage counts
- Video processing counts
- Guide generation counts
- Total processed frames
- Total processing time

#### Error Metrics

- Error counts by type
- Error rates
- Retry counts

### Viewing Metrics

You can view metrics using the built-in metrics viewer:

```bash
# View all metrics
transfer-learning metrics

# View performance metrics
transfer-learning metrics --type performance

# View usage metrics
transfer-learning metrics --type usage

# View metrics for a specific date
transfer-learning metrics --date 2023-02-25
```

## Real-time Monitoring

Transfer Learning provides real-time monitoring capabilities during command execution.

### Progress Bars

Commands display progress bars with the following information:

- Overall progress
- Current operation
- Estimated time remaining
- Processing rate (frames/second)
- Resource usage

### Status Updates

Status updates are displayed during long-running operations:

- Current batch being processed
- Completed batches
- Failed batches
- Retry attempts

## Monitoring API

For advanced use cases, you can access the monitoring system programmatically:

```python
from transfer_learning.monitoring.metrics import MetricsTracker
from transfer_learning.monitoring.logger import setup_logger

# Set up logger
logger = setup_logger("my_component")

# Create a metrics tracker
metrics = MetricsTracker("my_operation")

# Start tracking an operation
with metrics.track("process_frames"):
    # Perform operation
    process_frames()

# Log metrics
metrics.add_value("frames_processed", 100)
metrics.add_timing("processing_time", 45.2)

# Save metrics
metrics.save()

# Log messages
logger.info("Operation completed successfully")
logger.error("An error occurred", extra={"error_type": "api_error"})
```

## Alerting

Transfer Learning can be configured to send alerts for critical issues:

### Email Alerts

Configure email alerts by setting:

```
ENABLE_EMAIL_ALERTS=True
EMAIL_ALERT_RECIPIENT=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_ALERT_LEVEL=ERROR
```

### Webhook Alerts

Configure webhook alerts (e.g., for Slack or Discord) by setting:

```
ENABLE_WEBHOOK_ALERTS=True
WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your-webhook-url
WEBHOOK_ALERT_LEVEL=WARNING
```

## Performance Optimization

Monitoring data can help identify performance bottlenecks:

1. Check the `performance/` metrics to identify slow operations
2. Look for patterns in error logs
3. Adjust batch size and concurrency based on resource usage metrics
4. Consider upgrading hardware for resource-intensive operations
