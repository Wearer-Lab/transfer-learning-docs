## Development Environment Setup

This guide will help you set up a development environment for contributing to or extending the Transfer Learning video processing pipeline.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up your development environment, ensure you have:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- FFmpeg installed on your system
- An OpenAI API key (for testing)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transfer-learning.git
    cd transfer-learning
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a virtual environment">
    Using UV (recommended):
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    
    Or using venv:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install development dependencies">
    ```bash
    uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```
    
    This installs the package in development mode with all development dependencies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up pre-commit hooks">
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```
    
    This sets up Git hooks to automatically format and lint your code before commits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Create a `.env` file in the project root:
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
    LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Structure

The Transfer Learning project is organized as follows:

```
transfer_learning/
├── cli/                  # CLI command implementations
│   ├── commands/         # Individual command modules
│   └── utils/            # CLI utilities
├── core/                 # Core functionality
│   ├── video/            # Video processing components
│   ├── audio/            # Audio processing components
│   ├── guide/            # Guide generation components
│   └── models/           # AI model integrations
├── utils/                # Utility functions and helpers
├── monitoring/           # Monitoring and metrics collection
├── config/               # Configuration management
├── api/                  # API implementation
└── tests/                # Test suite
```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

Run the test suite to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

```bash
pytest
```

Run tests with coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=transfer_learning
```

### Code Style and Linting

The project uses Black for code formatting, isort for import sorting, and flake8 for linting:

```bash
# Format code
black transfer_learning tests

# Sort imports
isort transfer_learning tests

# Run linter
flake8 transfer_learning tests
```

These checks are automatically run by pre-commit hooks, but you can run them manually as needed.

### Building Documentation

To build and preview the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
npm install
mintlify dev
```

The documentation will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New CLI Command

1. Create a new file in `transfer_learning/cli/commands/` for your command
2. Implement your command using the Click library
3. Register your command in `transfer_learning/cli/__init__.py`
4. Add tests in `tests/cli/commands/`
5. Add documentation in `docs/cli/your-command.mdx`

Example of a new command implementation:

```python
import click
from transfer_learning.cli.utils import common_options

@click.command()
@common_options
@click.argument('input_path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
@click.option('--custom-option', help='Description of your custom option')
def your_command(input_path, custom_option, **kwargs):
    """Description of your command."""
    # Implement your command logic here
    click.echo(f"Processing {input_path} with {custom_option}")
```

### Adding Core Functionality

1. Identify the appropriate module for your feature
2. Implement your feature with proper error handling and logging
3. Add tests for your feature
4. Update documentation to reflect the new functionality

### Extending the API

1. Add your new functionality to the appropriate module in `transfer_learning/api/`
2. Ensure proper type hints and docstrings
3. Add tests for your API extension
4. Update the API reference documentation

## Submitting Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a branch">
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Implement your feature or fix, following the project's code style.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run tests">
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    
    Ensure all tests pass before submitting your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit your changes">
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
    ```
    
    Pre-commit hooks will automatically format and lint your code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push your changes">
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a pull request">
    Go to the GitHub repository and create a pull request from your branch.
    
    Provide a clear description of your changes and any related issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Release Process

The project follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md file
3. Create a new Git tag with the version number
4. Push the tag to trigger the release workflow

```bash
# Example for version 1.2.3
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

## Performance Considerations

When developing for Transfer Learning, keep these performance considerations in mind:

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
2. **Batch Processing**: Implement batching for operations that can be parallelized
3. **Memory Management**: Be mindful of memory usage, especially when processing large videos
4. **Caching**: Implement caching for expensive operations
5. **Monitoring**: Add appropriate metrics collection for new features
